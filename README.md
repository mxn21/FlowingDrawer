*For a working implementation of this project see the `app/` folder and check out the sample app*

activity_main.xml:

```xml
    <com.pdesire.fancy.flowingdrawer_core.FlowingDrawer
            xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
            xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
            android:id="@+id/drawerlayout"
            android:layout_width="match_parent"
            android:layout_height="match_parent"
            android:clipChildren="false"
            android:clipToPadding="false"
            app:edPosition="1"
            app:edMenuSize="260dp"
            app:edMenuBackground="#dddddd">

        <!--content-->
        <RelativeLayout
                android:id="@+id/content"
                android:layout_width="match_parent"
                android:layout_height="match_parent"/>

        <!--menu-->
        <com.pdesire.fancy.flowingdrawer_core.FlowingMenuLayout
                android:id="@+id/menulayout"
                android:layout_width="match_parent"
                android:layout_height="match_parent">

            <FrameLayout
                    android:id="@+id/id_container_menu"
                    android:layout_width="match_parent"
                    android:layout_height="match_parent"/>

        </com.pdesire.fancy.flowingdrawer_core.FlowingMenuLayout>

    </com.pdesire.fancy.flowingdrawer_core.FlowingDrawer>
```

To use a FlowingDrawer, position FlowingDrawer as the root , position your primary content view as the
first child with width and height of match_parent . Add FlowingMenuLayout as child views after the main
content view . FlowingMenuLayout commonly use match_parent for height and width.

Don't set any background on FlowingMenuLayout or FlowingMenuLayout's children, it means their background
should be transparent.

Don't set FlowingMenuLayout's width with a fixed width, it's not a useful way to change it's width .

You can change menu's attribute in FlowingDrawer layout node use custom attribute,like edMenuBackground,edMenuSize,
edPosition.

Use edPosition attribute corresponding to which side of the view you want the drawer
to emerge from: left or right.Left menu : edPosition =1 ; Right menu: edPosition =2 .

For more custom attribute ,you can see in attrs.xml.


MainActivity:

```java
     mDrawer = (FlowingDrawer) findViewById(R.id.drawerlayout);
     mDrawer.setTouchMode(ElasticDrawer.TOUCH_MODE_BEZEL);
     mDrawer.setOnDrawerStateChangeListener(new ElasticDrawer.OnDrawerStateChangeListener() {
                 @Override
                 public void onDrawerStateChange(int oldState, int newState) {
                     if (newState == ElasticDrawer.STATE_CLOSED) {
                         Log.i("MainActivity", "Drawer STATE_CLOSED");
                     }
                 }

                 @Override
                 public void onDrawerSlide(float openRatio, int offsetPixels) {
                     Log.i("MainActivity", "openRatio=" + openRatio + " ,offsetPixels=" + offsetPixels);
                 }
             });
```
setTouchMode can allows the drawer to be opened by dragging the edge or the entire screen.
setOnDrawerStateChangeListener can be used to monitor the state and motion of drawer views.
Avoid performing expensive operations such as layout during animation as it can cause stuttering.
ElasticDrawer.OnDrawerStateChangeListener offers default/no-op implementations of each callback method.
